# RSDKv2hx

A port of the [RSDKv2 Decompilation](https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv2-Decompilation) to Haxe!

For compiling you'll have to make the assets folder yourself.

You WILL need the original Data.bin file from Sonic Nexus to run this port, which you can get from [here](https://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Nexus)
